# ChestSorter

**ChestSorter** is a lightweight Minecraft plugin designed for Spigot/Paper servers (Minecraft 1.20 to latest) that automatically sorts chests by stacking similar items and ordering them alphabetically. Simply open a chest and perform a **shift-right click** in the chest's inventory to have your items neatly organized!

## Features

- **Automatic Stacking:** Combines similar stackable items to free up inventory space.
- **Alphabetical Sorting:** Items are sorted by their display name (if available) or material name.
- **Universal Compatibility:** Works with single, double, and trapped chests.

## Requirements
